# romp-wake.sh — event-driven judge trigger (design: event-based over time heuristics).
#
# Fires on the Claude Code events that create NEW work for the kernel — a turn
# ended (Stop), a prompt landed (UserPromptSubmit), or a compaction ended
# (PostCompact) — and pokes the kernel's POST /tick so the judge producer runs a
# pass NOW instead of waiting out its 3 s backstop, and the pusher's parked-op
# drain runs now instead of on its 0.5 s one. A tmux /compact ends at
# PostCompact: the poke wakes the drain, and the op queued behind the compact
# fires once the compaction is corroborated in the transcript (the boundary
# record). Without this the feed lags a completed turn by a backstop.
#
# Fire-and-forget: it MUST never block or fail a turn. The curl is detached into
# a subshell with a short timeout and every output/error is swallowed. If no
# kernel is listening (none running, or a headless/non-romp session) the poke
# fails silently — the backstops still cover it.

# Drain stdin (Claude Code sends the hook event as JSON) so we never SIGPIPE the
