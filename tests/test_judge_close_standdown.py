"""The closer stands down before newer diary evidence, and unblocker lifts ride its menu
(the user 2026-08-12/13, cluster B of the stuck-card program).

Two defects, both from the post-outage forensics:
  * The backlog sweep filed done/block verdicts anchored to a STALE turn's ev_t; the fold (the
    authority) orders by evidence time, so newer diary rows shadowed those verdicts SILENTLY while
    the turn sealed forever — a card lost two real completions this way. The standing corollary —
    a writer whose evidence predates the diary stands down — now applies at the closer's own write
    site: a verdict that would not change the node's folded state is dropped and logged loudly
    (stale-close). Deliberately NO requeue: the newer evidence's own turn is audited by the same
    oldest-first sweep, and a requeue can loop forever on a fold tie.
  * The unblocker's lift evidence often asserts the work SHIPPED, but it may only file unblock —
    done is the closer's authority. A node whose newest state-bearing row is an unheard lift now
    rides the closer's menu (with the lift's why in the note), and the landed reply's look-stamp
    retires the ride — an unstamped rider would re-nominate every pass forever, the exact one-shot
    defect this cluster deletes.

All fixtures synthetic (placeholder UUIDs, invented text).
