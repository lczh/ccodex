"""The judge scratch cwd is private, and romp refuses to judge without one.

JUDGE_SCRATCH used to be the literal "/tmp/romp-judge", created with `os.makedirs(..., exist_ok=True)`.
/tmp is world-writable and that name is guessable, so on any machine with a second local account someone
could create the path first — as a directory with permissions of their choosing, or as a SYMLINK — and
`exist_ok=True` would accept whatever they left there. Two things then follow, neither of them subtle:

  * `prune_judge_scratch` runs at every kernel boot, realpaths the scratch through `_proj_dir`, and
    unlinks every `*.jsonl` older than a day in the project dir that name derives to. Point the symlink
    at a directory you actually work in and romp's own housekeeping deletes YOUR Claude Code transcripts.
  * It is the cwd of a `claude -p` subprocess, and a cwd someone else controls is a cwd they can plant a
    `.claude/` in. `_judge_cmd`'s `--safe-mode` is what closes that today; the cwd should not be relying
    on it alone.

Nothing is written INTO the scratch — it is a bare cwd, and the transcripts land under ~/.claude/projects
— so this is about who controls the directory, not about what is stored in it.

So: the scratch lives under the 0700 state root, is created 0700, and a directory that cannot be made
private makes the judge call FAIL LOUDLY (an error row + a stderr line) rather than run from somewhere
anyone can write. All fixtures SYNTHETIC.
