"""Regression guard for the two sinks the Romp Postal Service feeds with strings that
arrive over the bus: PATH COMPONENTS under the mail/names roots (ids and names), and the
MAILDIR HEADER BLOCK deliver() writes (the sender's claimed name/id, and a relay's kind,
origin host and mid). The bus is token-gated now (test_postal_token.py), but these checks
stay as defense-in-depth: a crafted reference like `../../../etc` must be rejected before
any path join, and a line break inside a header value must not be able to rewrite the
rest of the block.

Synthetic only — placeholder UUIDs, hermetic temp state dir, no real session data.
