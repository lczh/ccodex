"""Transcript content reaching a judge is MATERIAL, never instructions.

A judge is a `claude -p` call over transcript-derived text: the segment, the turn, the work so far, the
open-goals menu, a peer's message. Whatever an agent restates in its own prose rides along with it — the
gist of a fetched page, an issue body, a CI log — so text an outsider authored can reach a judge, and a
judge verdict is durable (goal state, captions, the needs-you column, the copy the user reads). Before
this change the content went in behind plain tags (<segment>…</segment>) that sat beside the <note>
blocks the judges are taught to obey, so content could close its own section and forge romp's
instruction channel exactly.

The boundary is a per-call mark: <name MARK> … </name MARK>, an explicit distrust instruction in the
SYSTEM prompt (the half no content can reach), and any echo of the mark inside the content blanked. These
tests pin all three, plus the property that matters — an injection-shaped payload lands INSIDE a marked
section, never beside the notes.

They pin STRUCTURE, not verdict accuracy: no offline test can show that the marks leave a judge's
classification quality unchanged.

All fixtures SYNTHETIC: invented prose, hostname TESTHOST. No real session data.
