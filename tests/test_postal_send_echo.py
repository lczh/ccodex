"""send_message echoes what the DECLARATION did (the user 2026-07-26): a question or delegate records
the sender as waiting on the recipient — a real hold a mis-declared kind creates by accident (a
"question" whose prose said no reply was needed parked its sender for a day). The tool result reads
the cost back so the sender can self-correct while recall_message still works; a coordinate stays the
plain delivery line. Synthetic only — the bus call is stubbed, no live postal server."""
