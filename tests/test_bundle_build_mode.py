"""An INSTALL must ship a production bundle, and the two things that can build one must agree.

Without --production the dashboard shipped a development build: render.js — the chat pane's
code — was 578 KB of unminified JS the browser parsed before anything appeared (a slow chat load
on a fresh install, the user 2026-07-27). Minified it is 297 KB, with no sourcemaps emitted.

The drift this guards is subtle and silent: vscode-extension/install.sh builds dist at install
time, and the kernel's _ensure_bundles() REBUILDS it whenever a .ts/.css looks newer. If only one
passed --production, any later source touch would swap the served dashboard back to the slow
bundle on the next kernel restart, with nothing saying so. Source-level assertions, because the
real build needs npm install and a network.
