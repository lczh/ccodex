"""The closer's DONE-ANCHOR appends the recap segment only to goals the turn actually worked on
(the user 2026-08-14). A rider ruled from goal history — steps-finished, starved, status-report,
lift — keeps its organic trail, whose tail is where its work truly happened. Before this, every
resolved rider's trail gained the RULING turn's tail segment, so the read side (work anchor =
trail[-1]; the completed card's summary pin = newest subtree tail) deep-linked the card to the
ruling turn's unrelated prose: a summary click landed on later chatter minutes below the answer
the card was about.

All fixtures synthetic (placeholder UUIDs, invented text).
