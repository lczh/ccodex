"""_nudge_fire_list holds a due nudge only for what its why actually claims — "a judge has ruled on a
turn that hasn't finished yet". romp's own bookkeeping is not that, and neither is a user gesture.

Why it matters: the judges stamp a verdict with the TRIGGER of the segment it ruled on, so a verdict
about a turn romp has seen end never outruns the cut. romp's own writers stamp WALL-CLOCK now — an
interrupt lift, an awaiting stamp retired once the dispatched work came back — so on an idle session
their row is newer than the last ended turn by construction, and nothing can ever move past it. The
hold then stands forever (bar the 6h backstop), and because the stall surface screens this particular
why, the card shows no nudge, no chip, no reason: a working card on an idle session saying nothing,
which is the one state romp must never produce.

The 2026-08-01 silent card came through exactly here, via an interrupt lift. That writer now stamps
evidence time (test_interrupt_lift_evidence_time.py); this is the guard-side half, and it also closes
the route the awaiting-lift writer still leaves open. Synthetic fixtures only.
