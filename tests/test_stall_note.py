"""The STALL NOTE (the user 2026-07-23).

A goal that is neither finished nor blocked-on-you, but that romp's nudge gate is quietly holding, used to
say NOTHING for itself: the distiller waits for a completion, the briefer waits for a block, and the card
sat in Working with no explanation while nothing moved it. The staller is the third surface. These cover
the read side (which records count as a stall) and the wiring that keeps the two halves honest — the kernel
WRITES the deferral record and the judge READS it, so a drift between them is silent breakage.
