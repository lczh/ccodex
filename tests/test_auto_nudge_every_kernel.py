"""Auto Nudge is one switch for every attached machine, but each kernel stores its own copy.

The user 2026-08-14: Auto Nudge was switched off in the dashboard and the sessions running on the other
machine went on being nudged for days. Two halves to that, and this file covers the kernel's:

  ROUTING (ui/webview/federation.ts, pinned in multi-kernel-merge.test.ts) — setAutoNudge carries no
  session id, so it went to the local kernel alone and no remote ever heard it.

  DISPLAY (here) — the gear fills its box from /version, which answers for the kernel serving the page.
  A machine that disagreed was invisible: the box read unchecked while that kernel kept nudging. The
  /version poll the supervisor already runs per pass now carries each remote's own setting onto its
  /tunnels row, so the gear can say who differs instead of speaking for machines it cannot see.

An older remote kernel has no such field, and "didn't say" must not read as "off" — that would invent a
disagreement and, worse, invite a click that changes a setting nobody asked about. It stays None.

Synthetic only — placeholder host/token, a throwaway loopback server for the poll, no real state.
