"""The pane loader that a WS drop puts up must be able to come back DOWN.

The user 2026-07-28: the dashboard announced it had lost the connection every few seconds, and after each
one the chat pane sat under the romp loader until a manual reload.

_pane_spin's loader has exactly two ways down, and on a RE-show — the one `romp:wsdown` triggers — neither
of them worked:

  MutationObserver   fires when the content container gains a child. render.ts's ensureView inserts one
                     `.thread` div per session ONCE and keeps it in a map for the life of the page, so
                     after the first load the container's direct children never change again. Every
                     post-reconnect push mutates nodes that are already there, and a childList observer
                     is deaf to that. Right on a cold load, unreachable on a reconnect.
  30s failsafe       was armed once at page load, so it only ever covered the FIRST show. By the time a
                     drop re-showed the loader, that timer had fired long ago.

So the loader went up on the drop with nothing left that could take it down — a pane frozen behind an
overlay while the socket underneath had already reconnected and was streaming fine.

The fix keeps both exits but makes them repeatable: the failsafe re-arms on every show, and the shim
fires `romp:wsup` on a reconnect, which hides the loader — the socket being back is precisely the event
that ends "romp is reconnecting". Staleness of what's on screen is the shell's reload prompt's job
(raiseStale, same onopen), not the loader's.

Source-pinning, like the other _pane_spin tests (this JS has no jsdom harness).
