"""A chat pane with NO sessions must show something immediately, not spin for 30 seconds.

This is a contract between two files that have to agree, which is exactly why it broke:

  kernel.py's _pane_spin  hides the romp loader on an EVENT — a MutationObserver that fires when the
                          content container gains a child whose id is not the always-present
                          #live-ask host — plus a long failsafe timeout for a genuinely dead kernel.
  render.ts               is the only thing that ever puts children in #content.

While a session is loading that is precisely right. With NO sessions there is nothing to load, so
render.ts rendered nothing, the observer never fired, and the only escape left was the failsafe: every
load of a fresh install sat under the loader for the full 30s. A brand-new user's first impression of
romp was a half-minute spinner over an empty pane, identical on every refresh, because it was a timer
rather than work (the user 2026-07-27, on a clean v0.1.1 install).

The fix is not to shorten the timer — it was 8s once and that was WORSE, firing during a normal slow
cold start and leaving the loader hidden over a still-blank pane. The fix is that "no sessions" is a
real, renderable state, so the event path handles it and the failsafe goes back to meaning only what it
says: the kernel died.

Source-pinning, like the other chat-render tests (the renderer has no jsdom harness).
