"""The card-reply bulk-unblock leak (the user 2026-07-20): a reply to a card optimistically clears
EVERY block in its subtree (_unblock_subtree via optimistic_followup), but a reply answering one of
three asks does not answer the other two — they silently lost their needs-you status and became quiet
open subs nothing re-surfaced. The fix makes the lift PROVISIONAL: the followup planner pass receives
the still-dangling lifted asks (_lifted_by_reply) and re-asserts the ones the reply did not answer
(_reassert_blocks), with the reply segment as fresh evidence clamped strictly past the floor (the
integer-second clock can make the reply share the floor's stamp, and equality voids a block).
XDG_STATE_HOME is pointed at a temp dir BEFORE the judge loads. Synthetic fixtures only."""
