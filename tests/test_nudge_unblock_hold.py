"""A repeated unblock is not a settlement: the nudge stands down until the closer's next word.

Five false status checks in one live weekend (2026-08-10/11) fired in the same window: a goal
blocked on the USER's decision was flipped to 'working' by a judge's unblock — the planner's
"new work filed on this branch", the unblocker's "answered in passing" — while the decision was
still outstanding; the nudge read the flip as a stall and status-checked an idle session that was
waiting on the user; the closer re-filed essentially the same block (or done) seconds-to-minutes
later. The card ping-ponged blocked→working→blocked with no user action — the cards-move rule's
named anti-pattern — and each 'working' window produced a nudge.

The existing ev_t guard can't catch it: those unblocks rule on turns romp HAS seen end, which the
2026-07-30 "considered verdict" reasoning deliberately treats as nudgeable — and for a goal's
FIRST unblock that reasoning is pinned doctrine (its own incident was a wrongly-gagged nudge,
tests/test_awaiting_same_trigger_wedge.py). The discriminator between the incidents is the diary:
every flap fire had a PRIOR judge unblock already on the goal. So the hold takes only a goal whose
newest judge row is an unblock with an earlier judge unblock on record — already ping-ponged once,
still unsettled — and holds it loudly (deferral record + backstop) until the closer's next word. A
USER's own unblock (an interrupt re-engage) never counts on either end.

Synthetic fixtures throughout (invented goal text, placeholder ids).
