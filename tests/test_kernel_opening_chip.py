"""The opening chip's deciding event is per-backend, and it covers ONLY a spawn in flight.

A session whose transcript doesn't exist yet reads "opening" (2026-08-05: a just-spawned tab said
"Working" over a clock with no honest base). For tmux the transcript's first record is the only
observable, so the file IS the event. For an SDK session it isn't: a fresh SDK session writes NO
transcript until its first turn, so keying the chip on the file left a fully-up, idle session wearing
the animated opening dots until the user's first message — indefinitely (the user 2026-08-08, who read
minutes of dots as creation still running). The SDK backend knows the earlier designed event — the
handshake (snapshot `connected`, set the moment the client context opens) — and the override stands
down on it.

The override must also NOT outlive the create (the user 2026-08-13): `connected` is in-memory only, so
a created-but-never-messaged session whose CLI isn't up right now — the normal state of every fresh SDK
session after a kernel restart, since idle CLIs die with the kernel and boot reconcile leaves them
lazy — read the missing flag as "still opening" and wore the dots for HOURS, while one message would
wake it in seconds. The chip now keys on the backend's live `spawning` report (thread up, client not
yet): opening covers exactly the spawn/handshake window, and a dormant created session reads ready.

SYNTHETIC fixtures only (placeholder uuid, temp dirs), modeled on test_chat_payload_clock_invariant.
