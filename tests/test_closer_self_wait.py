"""The closer never files awaiting on SELF-work (the 2026-08-18 awaiting audit).

A session that says it will finish the remaining checks/cleanup ITSELF got a kindless awaiting
stamp — which stands the nudge ladder down and buys a six-hour sleep for work only the session's
own next turn can move (the awaited event already happened two minutes later and nothing lifted
the stamp). CLOSER_SYS now names the case as an omit: awaiting is only for waits that end with a
result ARRIVING from outside; self-work stays working so the normal follow-through cadence
produces the next turn. Prompt pins, matching the existing closer-rule test idiom."""
