// What a disconnected host looks like from inside the chat (the user 2026-07-30, watching a remote flap).
//
// Three changes, one complaint: the only cue was a strikethrough on the "host:" token, which said the
// wrong thing in the wrong place and said nothing at all about the message you were about to lose.
//
//   1. Strikethrough reads as CANCELLED. The session is fine; the LINK is down and what is on screen is
//      the last state romp got. That is "stale", and romp already has a treatment for stale.
//   2. The tab mark is peripheral once you are reading. The transcript itself should say why it ends.
//   3. Nothing stopped a send into a session whose kernel is unreachable.
