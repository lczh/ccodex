// A card's column must not bounce through a stale payload after a reply — and when a view DOES
// bounce, the bounce must leave a record (the user 2026-07-28).
//
// The incident: the user replied to a Completed card, watched it fly to Working, flash back to
// Completed, then return to Working. Post-hoc, every layer checked out sound — the store held
// "working" the whole window, the snapshot punch applied, the ack/buildId machinery held — and
// nothing anywhere recorded what the view actually rendered, so the bounce could not be attributed.
// Two fixes, pinned here:
//
// (1) KERNEL: the _views_dirty check compared the mark against the cached build's FINISH time, so a
//     reply landing while a ~1-1.6s build was in flight was swallowed when that build completed —
//     its payload predates the gesture, but its finish postdates it — and the pre-reply payload
//     (card still Completed) was re-served until the next sig bust. The dirty floor now keys on the
//     build's START; REBUILD_MIN_S stays on the finish (it rate-limits build cost).
//
// (2) CLIENT: every rendered column change posts a clientDiag breadcrumb (what moved, from/to, the
//     input event the render reflects, the payload's buildId, whether a prediction was live), so
//     the next bounce is read from client-diag.jsonl instead of unreproducible archaeology.
//
// Source-level pins (no jsdom for the feed renderer), mirroring feed-move-ack.
