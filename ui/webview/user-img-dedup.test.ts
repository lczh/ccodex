// 2026-07-08 mentioned-path thumbnail feature made linkifyFileUris ALSO thumb that literal path —
// same file, small thumb + big image. Fix: the user bubble passes its ev.images paths as
// linkifyFileUris' skipThumbs, so an already-rendered image is excluded from the path-thumbs strip
// (it stays a clickable link). render.ts has import-time DOM side effects → source pins + an
// executed replica of the collection decision (feed-artifacts.test.ts precedent).
