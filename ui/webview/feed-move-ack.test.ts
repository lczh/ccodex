// A predicted card move ends on the kernel's ANSWER, never on a stopwatch (the user 2026-07-21).
//
// The bug: replying to a card flipped it to Working, then ~4s later a toast claimed "That follow-up didn't
// move the card to Working — the session may not have picked it up" and the card fell back to Completed,
// while the session was already several tool calls into working that very reply. Two causes, both fixed
// here. (1) The feed serves a goal-store snapshot frozen for the length of a judge pass, and the reply's
// reopen went to the LIVE store — so a reply landing mid-pass was invisible for the whole pass, routinely
// 30-80 seconds, and no window the client could wait was ever going to be long enough. (2) The client was
// timing the kernel out at all, for something the kernel knows exactly: whether the reopen applied.
//
// So the kernel punches user writes through the snapshot (test_kernel.py) and ANSWERS the prediction with
// cardMoveAck: ok=false is the one real failure worth interrupting for, and buildId names which payload is
// the answer to this gesture. Source-level pins (no jsdom for the feed renderer), mirroring feed-move-button.
