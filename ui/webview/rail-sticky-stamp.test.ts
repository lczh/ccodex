// Sticky rail stamp (the user 2026-07-22). restampMarkers can only stamp at a turn boundary, so a single
// message taller than the viewport leaves the rail blank while you scroll through it. paintRailSticky keeps a
// stamp in the top slot at a fixed buffer line (cTop + 6). A real marker LEADS while its top is at or below
// that line; the instant it crosses ABOVE the line the sticky takes the slot — same position, same time — and
// the crossed marker is hidden. So the hand-off is seamless: no gap where the slot goes empty, and no clipped
// duplicate sliding past (the user 2026-07-23). Exactly one stamp sits at the line at all times.
//
// The chat renderer has no jsdom harness, so — like the other render.ts tests — pin at the source, plus an
// executed replica of the pure selection + hand-off decision (the property most worth protecting).
