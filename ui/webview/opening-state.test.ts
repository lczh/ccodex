// A just-opened session said "Working" over an epoch-sized clock while its transcript didn't exist yet
// (the user 2026-08-05, who wanted "opening" with animated dots until it's ready). The fix is layered:
// the KERNEL reports state "opening" for a spawned session whose transcript isn't on disk (the first
// record is the deciding event — discover() then takes over), and the CLIENT shows the same line for a
// tab whose session payload hasn't arrived at all (which previously left the PREVIOUS tab's statusline
// standing). Same in-progress line treatment as compacting, dots in the accent per the loader rule.
