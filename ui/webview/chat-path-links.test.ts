// Chat file links are filesystem-VERIFIED, and shortened mentions are FIXED.
// The linkifier matched path-shaped tokens by SHAPE alone, so a bare `render.js` became a blue link
// that 404'd on click — it resolved against the session's cwd, where no such file lives. The KERNEL
// now resolves every shape-matched token at message-build time (build_session's _path_links: tier 1
// exact stat, tiers 2/3 a UNIQUE match in `git ls-files -co --exclude-standard` run in the session's
// cwd) and ships {token: open target} as `pathLinks` on user + assistant events. The client keeps
// every shape gate it had and merely requires map membership; the map's value is what a click opens,
// so a unique `sub/deep.py` mention opens the real kernel/sub/deep.py and hover shows that target.
// Zero or several candidates → absent from the map → prose (a silently-wrong link is worse than no
// link). render.ts has no jsdom harness → source pins + an executed tokenizer parity check over the
// shared fixture (the kernel side runs the same fixture in tests/test_path_links.py).
